    "# Exploring IPO Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was taken from the SEC database of public records. The file urls were taken from Financial Market Prep via an api endpoint. Roughly 14k IPOs are in that list from FMP. However after post processing, only 2000 actually had useable data that could be extracted from those HTML files. The following is the exploration of a final raw dataset crafted from those 2000 HTML files.\n",

    "Predict the outcome of an IPO's first day of trading. In this data, there is a **diff** column that is either positive or negative. It represents the change in price on the opening day for the ipo. This notebook will explore which features are important to the prediction of our target column."
